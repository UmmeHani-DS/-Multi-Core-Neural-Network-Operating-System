# -Multi-Core-Neural-Network-Operating-System

### Introduction
This project focuses on designing an operating system that harnesses the computational power of multi-core processors to accelerate neural network computations. By leveraging separate processes and threads, it facilitates efficient inter-process communication for exchanging data such as weights and biases. Each layer of the neural network is represented by a distinct process, with individual neurons operating as threads.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an operating system architecture that optimizes the training and inference process of neural networks by utilizing parallel processing on multi-core processors. The aim is to enhance computational efficiency, speed up training, and improve the overall performance of neural network models.

### Methodologies
1. **Modular Design**: Each neural network layer is assigned to a separate process, ensuring encapsulation and modularity.
2. **Fine-Grained Parallelism**: Neurons within each layer operate as threads, allowing for fine-grained parallelism and efficient resource utilization.
3. **Inter-Process Communication**: Pipes facilitate seamless data exchange, including weights and biases, between layers and neurons.
4. **Backpropagation Optimization**: During backpropagation, error signals propagate backward through layers, utilizing multi-core processing to expedite computations.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Operating System**: Linux (preferably Ubuntu)
- **Libraries and Tools**: System calls and libraries studied in OS labs (e.g., fork(), wait(), pipes), pthread library

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of operating system concepts to accelerate neural network computations. By harnessing the power of multi-core processors and implementing efficient inter-process communication mechanisms, it enhances computational efficiency and pushes the boundaries of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
