# -Multi-Core-Neural-Network-Operating-System
This project implements a neural network architecture using separate processes and threads on a multi-core processor. It utilizes inter-process communication through pipes for exchanging weights and biases between processes. Implemented in C++, it leverages multi-core processing for efficient training. Designed for Linux environments.
